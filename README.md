# techdegree-project-2
Project #2 for FSJS

This project that I created takes the provided student-list from the provided index.html and
simply adds pagination to them where it only allows 10 students per page. It also contains search 
bar that automatically searches every time you press a key. I had to use for loops, constants, lets, and much more.

I did attempt to Exceed Expectations (All done and working):
- Add search component
- Add functionality to the search component
- Paginate search results
- Handle no results returned
